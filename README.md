# SPEARHEAD project code

This repository contains the source code produced within the Innosuisse Flagship **SPEARHEAD**, supporting the deliverables:

- **D2.4 – Digital platform live** (web-based interface for interactive exploration of resistance prediction models)
- **D2.6 – Main publication of the risk prediction model** (analysis pipeline and experiments for the manuscript)

## Contents

### Web app (D2.4)
The `SPEARHEAD-webapp/` directory contains the code and assets for the web-based interface used to interactively explore the trained resistance prediction models.

Web interface: https://christian-berchtold-spearhead.share.connect.posit.cloud/

### Manuscript analyses (D2.6)
The `SPEARHEAD-manuscript/` directory contains the analysis code (scripts, notebooks, and supporting utilities) used to reproduce the experiments and results reported in the manuscript on EHR-based antibiotic resistance prediction. The figures of the manuscript are also included in this directory.
